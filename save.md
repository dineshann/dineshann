### **Financial Modeling: A Framework for THE**

A financial model provides a roadmap for a business's financial performance. Since specific operational details like daily sales volume and staff salaries are not provided, this is a simplified framework with assumptions to illustrate the key components.

#### **1. Startup Costs (Assumptions)**

The initial investment for THE is a crucial starting point.

* **HealthRX Mobile Truck:** ₹20,00,000
* **Initial Inventory:** Cost of ingredients, bottles, packaging, etc. (Assume ₹50,000)
* **Medical Equipment:** ECG machine, blood/urine sample collection kits, etc. (Assume ₹2,00,000)
* **Permits & Licensing:** Registration, health permits, etc. (Assume ₹1,00,000)
* **Marketing & Launch:** Initial promotion, branding (Assume ₹50,000)
* **Working Capital:** Cash reserve for initial operations (Assume ₹1,00,000)
* **Total Initial Investment:** ₹25,00,000

#### **2. Revenue Projections (Assumptions)**

This section projects revenue based on assumed daily sales.

**Assumption:** The truck operates 22 days per month.

* **Nutritional Shots & Water:** Assume 50 units sold per day.
    * Daily Revenue: 50 units x ₹50/unit = ₹2,500
    * Monthly Revenue: ₹2,500/day x 22 days = ₹55,000
* **Salads:** Assume 20 units sold per day.
    * Daily Revenue: 20 units x ₹100/unit = ₹2,000
    * Monthly Revenue: ₹2,000/day x 22 days = ₹44,000
* **Health Services (Analysis & Checkups):** Assume 5 customers per day.
    * Daily Revenue: 5 customers x ₹1,200 (average of ₹1,150 & ₹1,250) = ₹6,000
    * Monthly Revenue: ₹6,000/day x 22 days = ₹1,32,000
* **Monthly Subscriptions:** Assume 10 new subscriptions per month.
    * Monthly Revenue: 10 subscriptions x ₹31,500 = ₹3,15,000
* **Total Monthly Revenue:** ₹55,000 + ₹44,000 + ₹1,32,000 + ₹3,15,000 = **₹5,46,000**

#### **3. Monthly Operating Expenses (Assumptions)**

This section outlines the recurring costs to operate the business.

* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Cost of ingredients for food/shots. (Assume 30% of product revenue: 0.30 x ₹99,000 = ₹29,700)
* **Salaries:** 2 employees (e.g., driver/preparer and a medical technician). (Assume ₹60,000 per month)
* **Rent/Depreciation:** The truck's cost should be depreciated over its useful life (e.g., 5 years). (₹20,00,000 / 60 months = ₹33,333 per month)
* **Fuel & Maintenance:** (Assume ₹15,000 per month)
* **Utilities:** (Assume ₹5,000 per month)
* **Marketing & Advertising:** (Assume ₹10,000 per month)
* **Other Expenses:** (e.g., insurance, payment processing fees) (Assume ₹10,000 per month)
* **Total Monthly Expenses:** ₹29,700 + ₹60,000 + ₹33,333 + ₹15,000 + ₹5,000 + ₹10,000 + ₹10,000 = **₹1,73,033**

#### **4. Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)**

This shows the business's profitability on a monthly basis.

* **Total Monthly Revenue:** ₹5,46,000
* **Total Monthly Expenses:** ₹1,73,033
* **Net Profit:** ₹5,46,000 - ₹1,73,033 = **₹3,72,967**

#### **5. Break-Even Analysis**

This determines how long it would take to recoup the initial investment.

* **Total Initial Investment:** ₹25,00,000
* **Average Monthly Net Profit:** ₹3,72,967
* **Time to Break Even:** ₹25,00,000 / ₹3,72,967 = **~6.7 months**

This financial model is illustrative. A complete plan would require more detailed research and conservative sales projections to assess viability.
